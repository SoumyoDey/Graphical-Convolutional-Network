# Graphical-Convolutional-Network

Cora python file consists code where I applied GCN on cora dataset and tried to find importance and threat score for each node by providing them with a random weight

Final GCN python file is where I applied GCN on MBTA dataset. Made a dynamic visualization to see who each node changes and finally did EDA to understand the data
